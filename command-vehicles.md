# Ironsworn: Starforged: Starship Depot

Come on down to Honest Entity's Starship Dealership! If you're tired of your boring, regular ol' Starship Command Vehicle, have I got the lineup for you! Enjoy 5 different ways to see space, each with its own emphasis and focus! My ships are so cheap, I'm practically giving them away. In fact, I AM giving them away.

Please don't sue me, Shawn:

### Luxury Cruiser

- [x] Your starship is suited for comfortable leisure rides and entertainment. It carries minimal armor and armaments. It can comfortably transport dozens of people, has space for cargo, and can carry and launch support vehicles. When you *Advance*, you may spend experience to equip this ship with module assets.
- [ ] When you *Undertake an Expedition* and score a strong hit with a match, you found relaxation and comfort during your ride. Take +1 spirit.
- [ ] If your starship does not have Depleted marked, you may take an automatic weak hit to *Sojourn* inside your ship by making use of its amenities. If you do, mark Depleted. The next time you *Sojourn* outside your starship, you may unmark Depleted as one of your options.

**Asset Track:** 0 to +3

**New Impact Possible:** Depleted

**Notes:** Now, this little number is designed for the pilot who just wants to have a good time. It's not sturdy, it's not built to be that. What it IS build to be, is an awful lot of fun, raising spirits as you travel through space. In a pinch? Empty out the cash bar, reroute power from the hot tubs, dig into the fun stuff and replenish yourself just a little bit. It'll count as an impact until you can dock-and-restock, but sometimes that's just the extra bit of oomph you need.


### Heavy Driver

- [x] Your armed, armored starship is suited for combat and high-risk environments. It can be manned by several people, has space for cargo, and can carry and launch support vehicles. When you *Advance*, you may spend experience to equip this vehicle with module assets.
- [ ] When you *Withstand Damage*, you may reroll your action die if it is less than your integrity.
- [ ] When you *Clash* with your starship's weaponry, you may roll +integrity. If you do, *Lose Momentum* (-2).

**Asset Track:** 0 to +6

**Notes:** The Heavy Driver here is for the spacer who needs a ride that can take a beating. With a whopping 6 integrity, rerolls when you *Withstand Damage*, and even an option when you *Clash*, this girl can keep going when other ships would be salvage. Don't think she's all turtle, though: With 6 integrity, modules that roll for +integrity could potentially be even more powerful than on the standard model, so fit her well and she'll treat you right.

### Flex Flyer

- [x] Your armed, armored starship built to be built upon. It can comfortably transport several people, has space for cargo and enhancements, and can carry and launch support vehicles. When you *Advance*, you may spend experience to equip this vehicle with module assets.
- [ ] You may purchase or upgrade a module for 1 less experience. When you *Repair* a module, spend 1 repair point (instead of 2).
- [ ] When you fully upgrade a module, this ever-customized ship increasingly feels like your own work. You and your allies may mark 1 tick on your bonds legacy track.

**Asset Track:** 0 to +4

**Notes:** Now, I know what you're thinking: You LOVE modules. But you hate having to spend the entirety of your life's efforts to get them. Well, don't you worry: Ol' Entity's got you covered. The Flex Flyer lets you buy and upgrade modules cheaper, letting you fit out your ship that much faster. For each module you max out, the closer you get to the ship itself. The ship of your dreams is easier than ever with this baby.

### Outland Ranger

- [x] Your armored, armored starship was designed for scouting and inquiry. It can comfortably transport several people, has space for cargo and enhancements, and can carry and launch support vehicles. When you *Advance*, you may spend experience to equip this vehicle with module assets.
- [ ] When you *Explore a Waypoint* using this ship's instruments (decide before rolling):
  - Add +1.
  - On a miss, reroll the action die if it less than the ship's integrity.
- [ ] When you *Undertake an Expedition* in remote space and score a strong hit with a match, envision the compelling sight you find and take +2 momentum. If you *Explore a Waypoint* here, reroll any dice.

**Asset Track:** 0 to +5

**Notes:** The Outland Ranger's a ship for those who feel like poking their nose into things. Out in the depths of space, this beauty is kitted out with everything you need to *Explore a Waypoint* and, fingers crossed, *Make a Discovery* (or *Confront Chaos*, but I can't talk about that for liability purposes). Even if you strike out on discovering gold - literally or figuratively - all that exploring is an excellent source of momentum.

### Scrap Rattler

*When you Overcome Destruction and score a weak hit or miss, you may acquire this Command Vehicle at no cost.*

- [x] Your questionable vehicle has 2 integrity. With enough optimism, is suitable for both interstellar and terrestrial travel. It can allegedly house several people and has space for light luggage. This vehicle can house 1 support vehicle. When you *Advance*, you may equip this vehicle with up to 1 module asset.
- [ ] Your starship has 3 integrity.
- [ ] When you *Fulfill Your Vow* and clear the indebted impact, gain this ability at no cost. You may then exchange this asset for another Command Vehicle with the same number of marked abilities.

**Asset Track:** 0 to +3

**Notes:** ...Ah. You're not the first person to have their starship destroyed, and you're not gonna be the last. People like to take the broken parts, mash 'em together, do a little welding, slap an eidolon drive on it, and flip it to the dumb or desperate. I dunno which of those you are and I'm not gonna ask. You need as ship, it's all yours, no experience necessary. I won't lie: It's a junker. A stiff breeze will rip it apart, much less a void storm. It can only fit 1 support vehicle and 1 module asset. But hey, if it survives whatever you've gotten yourself into, maybe you'll get an upgrade and get to pocket the difference.
