## Base Asset
### Custom Weapon

- [x] Give your personal, customizable weapon a name. Decide if it is described as Melee or Ranged, and if it is Light or Heavy. When you *Advance*, you may equip this weapon with up to two Weapon Mod cards that either match its description or are Exotic.
- [ ] When you *Enter the Fray* or *Endure Stress* while wielding your weapon, add +1 and take +2 momentum on a hit.
- [ ] When you *Take Decisive Action* against a notable foe and score a strong hit with a match, envision how your signature weapon becomes tied to your personal legacy. Then, mark 2 ticks on either your bonds or quests legacy track.

## Melee


### Tempo

*Your weapon turns minor advantages into decisive moments.*
- [ ] When you Gain Ground by attempting to disarm, trip, shove, grapple, or stun your foe, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- [ ] When you Strike or Clash and burn momentum to improve your result, mark progress. If the fight continues, add +1 on your next move.


### Riposte

*Your weapon is meant to stop a foe's aggression.*
- [ ] When you Clash and score a strong hit, add +1 if you immediately follow with a Strike. If that Strike is a strong hit, you are unstoppable; mark progress.
- [ ] When you Clash in close quarters, you may draw on your momentum to gain advantage. If you do, Lose Momentum (-2) and choose one (before rolling).
  - Aggressive: Count a weak hit as a strong hit.
  - Defensive: Count a miss as a weak hit.


## Ranged


### Precise

*Your ranged weapon is tuned for methodical, accurate shots.*
- [ ] When you Gain Ground by taking a moment to aim, choose your approach and add +1.
  - Trust your instincts: Roll +wits, and take +2 momentum on a strong hit.
  - Line up your shot: Roll +edge, and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- [ ] When you Gain Ground or React Under Fire by moving into cover, add +1. On a strong hit, this cover gives you leverage; add +1 when you make a move to attack or defend at range. If you then score a miss, the cover is lost or compromised.


### Barrage

*Your ranged weapon fires shots like nothing else.*
- [ ] When you Strike, choose one (decide before rolling):
  - Hold them back: Keep control on a weak hit, but only mark progress once.
  - Pin them down: Add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
  - Make it hurt: Mark progress on a hit.
- [ ] Once per fight, when you Strike or Clash, you may take extra shots and Sacrifice Resources (-1) (decide before rolling). If you do, reroll any dice. On a hit, take +1 momentum and mark progress twice.


## Light


### Duelist

*Your weapon favors flashy, yet risky displays of combat technique.*
- [ ] When you Strike or Clash, you may (decide before rolling) add +2. If you do, mark progress on a strong hit and count a weak hit as a miss.
- [ ] Once per fight, when you Gain Ground +edge through a bold display of your combat prowess, you may reroll any dice. On a strong hit with a match, mark progress.


### Stealth

*Your weapon is easily concealable.*
- [ ] When you Enter the Fray +shadow by preparing to act without tipping them off, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, your surprise is effective: mark progress.
- [ ] When you are in position to Strike at an unsuspecting foe, choose one (before rolling).
  - Add +2 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
  - Mark progress twice on a hit.

## Heavy


### Overwhelming

*Your weapon lacks finesse but compensates in destruction.*
- [ ] When you attempt to Strike a foe with concussive power, you may (decide before rolling) suffer -2 momentum. If you do, on a strong hit, you create an opening by knocking your foe back, stunning them, or putting them off balance: mark progress and add +1 on your next move.
- [ ] Once per fight, when you are in a bad spot, you may Strike with all the fury and power you can muster. If you do (decide before rolling), you may reroll any dice and mark progress twice on a strong hit, but count a weak hit as a miss and envision the dire and extreme consequences for your attempt.

### Threatening

*Your weapon is a terrifying presence.*
- [ ] When you Compel or Gain Ground with the threat of violence by brandishing your weapon at someone, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- [ ] When you Take Decisive Action by bringing your foe to a messy, undignified end, you may burn momentum to reroll one challenge die. If you do, Endure Stress (2 stress). If fighting continues, your remaining foes are unnerved: mark progress on their encounter(s).

## Exotic


### Powered

*Your weapon utilizes a unique energy system, charged with 5 energy. When you Resupply to recharge your weapon, take any +supply as +energy instead, up to a maximum of 5 energy. When you make a move enhanced by powering your weapon, you may suffer -1, -2, or -3 energy to add +that amount.*
- [ ] When you make a move using your weapon's energy system as above and score a strong hit with a match, choose one:
  - Your action used less energy than expected: take +1 energy.
  - Your powered weapon proved especially effective: take +2 momentum.
- [ ] When you Strike or Clash utilizing the energy system to enhance your blow, mark progress on a strong hit.

### Utility

*Your weapon is also designed for mundane, non-combat purposes. Give it a role.*
- [ ] When you make a move that leverages your weapon in its role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- [ ] Your weapon has functions even you're not aware of. When you Check Your Gear and score a miss, you may try experimenting with your weapon's less documented functions. If you do, reroll all dice. If you score a miss yet again, envision the dire accident you cause.
